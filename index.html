        In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations
        of Westalis and Ostania, a Westalian agent code-named "Twilight"
        is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National
        Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being
        notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him
        is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons
        and pose as a fellow parent.

        To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he
        creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named
        Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to
        him Anya can read minds and Yor is in fact a professional
        assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true
        identities, or that Anya knows their true professions. The family
        later takes in a dog with precognitive abilities whom they name
        Bond. Despite these unknown factors and Twilight's occasional
        lapses of common sense due to years of being a spy, he must learn to
        play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to
        carry out his mission
